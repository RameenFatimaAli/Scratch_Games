# Pong Game - Scratch Project

Welcome to my **Pong Game**, a classic arcade-style game recreated using Scratch!

## About the Game

Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games, featuring a simple two-dimensional table tennis gameplay. The player controls a paddle that moves vertically along one side of the screen, trying to bounce a ball past the opponent‚Äôs paddle to score points.

This project is my Scratch implementation of Pong, inspired by the original game but with my own tweaks and customizations.

## How to Play

- Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to move your paddle vertically.
- The goal is to hit the ball past the opponent‚Äôs paddle to score a point.
- The ball bounces off the top and bottom edges of the screen.
- If the ball passes your paddle, the opponent scores.
- First to reach a set score (e.g., 10 points) wins the game.
- Try to improve your reflexes and beat your opponent!

## Features

- Classic Pong gameplay recreated in Scratch.
- Simple controls for easy playability.
- Scorekeeping system to track points.
- Ball physics including bouncing off paddles and walls.
- Sound effects for ball hits and scoring (if implemented).
- Visual effects with sprites and backgrounds designed in Scratch.

## Development Notes

- I built this game to practice programming logic, sprite control, and event handling in Scratch.
- The ball‚Äôs movement and collision detection were implemented using Scratch blocks.
- I experimented with scoring and reset logic to enhance gameplay flow.
- Feel free to remix or improve the game and share your version!
